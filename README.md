# PlanarPoseEstimation
Pose estimation of a textured color planar model using deep learning. The image sets can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ekjJWqiP_yGI03aCx6OOPuHRh_C7_lHa/view?usp=sharing). The files **D1_mean_img.npy** and **D2_mean_img.npy** are the mean images for the train D1 and D2 datasets, respectively. The files **D1_labels.csv** and **D2_labels.csv** contain the image-pose correspondences for the D1 and D2 datasets, respectively.
